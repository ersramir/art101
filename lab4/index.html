	<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
	<p>This lab was intended to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>During this lab, I didn't seem to have too much trouble creating the file structure. But I can't really show the
		files in my folder because it just takes me to a different screen.  </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>

	<pre><code>
		//Pokemon Battle
		//Start Battle, place both player and enemy pokemon on screen
		  //Battle Loop
		  //Get Player Input
		    //If “attack,” save attack data. If “item,” run item usage. If “flee” and is not a trainer battle, roll flee chance. If the flee is successful, end the battle loop.
		      //If player attack
		        //Compare Player and Enemy Speeds
		        //If player first, run player attack then enemy attack
		        //If enemy first, run enemy attack then player attack
		      //Else
		        //Run enemy attack
		      //Check hp of pokemon on field, if hp 0, faint
		      //Check the number of pokemon on each side, if 0 on either, end battle loop.
		    //If Trainer pokemon is 0, blackout and end combat scene
		    //If Opponent pokemon is 0, declare the player winner and end combat scene.
		    //Else, player has fled and end combat scene.
