		<h1>Lab 3 File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>This lab was intended to create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>During this lab, I didn't seem to have too much trouble creating the file structure. But I can't really show the
			files in my folder because it just takes me to a different screen.  </p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
